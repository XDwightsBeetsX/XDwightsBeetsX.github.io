                My name is John Gutierrez, and I am the loudest and </b>proudest member of the 
                fightin Texas Aggie class of '22 EY WHOOP!

                I'm studying Mechanical Engineering, with a minor in Computer Science. I am 
                passianate about applying a computational and robust computer science approach to 
                mechanical engineering challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm currently learning to write production level code for the A&M 
                Engineering System Lab Compass site, a web page where clients analyze building HVAC data 
                such as airflow, humidity, and temperatures. I got started writing 
                python scripts in the past to help transition a government database 
                away from Excel.

                Team In Deep Ship finished the 2019 TWS in 58:12m, and were looking forward 
                to setting a new best in 2020 until the coronavirus pandemic delayed 
                the race until it was eventually cancelled. The race is 260 miles and the fastest teams finish in about 40 hours, 
                depending on the year's water level and conditions.

                John Bugge, a TWS legend, is well known for his racing canoes 
                and we used his boats both years, putting them to the test as we 
                scraped our way down the San Marcos and Guadalupe rivers in over 
                300 miles of training each year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite surviving the grueling training runs, while portaging a dam early in the race 
                one of our paddlers tore tendons in his knee and was forced to drop out, 
                cheering the team on from our supply crew.
