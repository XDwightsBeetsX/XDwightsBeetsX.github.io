        I'm studying Mechanical Engineering, with a minor in Computer Science. I am 
        passianate about applying a computational and robust computer science approach to 
        mechanical engineering challenges.

        I'm currently learning to write production level code for the A&M 
        Engineering System Lab Compass site, a web page where clients analyze building HVAC data 
        such as airflow, humidity, and temperatures. I got started writing 
        python scripts in the past to help transition a government database 
        away from Excel, but now I work on my own projects like learning web development 
        and other projects.

        I like to go hiking at state parks, and thanks to COVID I'm learning to play guitar! 
        The last two years I've taken part in a canoe race known as the Texas Water Safari which has 
        been an amazing experience with my close friends. Check it out on the other page!
